Website was created for an 'escape room' style puzzle chain for friends. It is not intended for public consumption.

Templates folder is legacy. If I ever decide to go back and fix HTML templating, they'll be useful again.

Eventually this ReadMe will contain a walkthrough. Need to actually create the puzzles first
